# Convai NPC AI Engine-Dialog, Actions for Unity3D
ConvAIâ€™s NPC AI Engine is a powerful, no-code solution for Unity 3D that enables developers to create lifelike, interactive NPCs with advanced dialog systems, behavioral actions, dynamic voice synthesis, and realistic lip-sync animations. Designed for both indie developers and AAA studios, this engine leverages AI-driven natural language processing (NLP), procedural behavior logic, and real-time audio-visual synchronization to deliver next-generation NPC interactions.


## 1. Dynamic Dialog System
ConvAIâ€™s NPCs can engage in natural, context-aware conversations with players, responding intelligently to speech or text inputs.

## Key Features:
### - Real-Time Speech & Text Processing 
 - Players can speak or type, and NPCs understand and respond naturally.

###  Contextual Memory & Continuity 

-  NPCs remember past interactions, allowing for evolving relationships and persistent world-building.

### Personality & Emotion Modeling 

- Each NPC can have unique traits (e.g., friendly, aggressive, sarcastic) and react  emotionally to events.

### Multi-Turn Dialog Trees 
- Conversations flow organically without rigid scripting, supporting branching narratives.

### NPC-to-NPC Interactions 
- AI characters can autonomously converse with each other, with players able to interrupt or join.

### Custom Knowledge Base 
-  NPCs can be trained on game lore, quest details, or world-specific information.

## 2. AI-Driven Actions & Behaviors

NPCs donâ€™t just talkâ€”they perform actions based on player commands, environmental triggers, or their own AI-driven decision-making.

## Key Features:
### Atomic vs. Complex Actions

- Atomic Actions â€“ Simple, single-step behaviors (e.g., "Walk," "PickUp," "Attack").

- Complex Action Sequences â€“ Multi-step tasks (e.g., "Fetch a sword" â†’ Moveâ†’PickUpâ†’Return).

### Feasibility & Personality Checks

- NPCs evaluate whether an action is possible (e.g., "Canâ€™t swim without water").

- Personality influences responses (e.g., a "lazy" NPC may refuse to run errands).

### Unity Physics Integration 
Actions respect in-game physics, ensuring realistic movement and interactions.

### Event-Driven Behaviors 
NPCs can react to world events (e.g., fleeing from danger, celebrating victories).

### 4. Automatic Lip-Sync & Facial Animation
 ConvAI ensures seamless synchronization between NPC speech and facial movements for maximum immersion.

 ## Key Features:
### Viseme & Blendshape Mapping 
 - Automatically converts speech into mouth movements (jaw, lips, tongue).

### Bone-Based Animation Support 
 - Works with both blendshapes and skeletal rigs for stylized characters.

### Customizable Effectors 
-  Developers can fine-tune how speech affects facial features.

### Real-Time Sync 
 - Lip movements perfectly match generated speech without manual animation.

 ## 5. No-Code Unity Integration

Designed for accessibility, ConvAIâ€™s Unity plugin requires no programming knowledge to set up.

### Key Features:
###  Drag-and-Drop Plugin 
 - Available on the Unity Asset Store (URP/HDRP compatible).

### Web-Based Dashboard

-  Configure NPC personalities, voices, and actions without coding.

### Pre-Built Templates

 - Ready-made presets for RPGs, FPS, social sims, and VR experiences.

### Cross-Platform Support 
 - Works on PC, mobile, VR, and consoles.
